Domestic cats (Felis catus) have lived alongside humans for thousands of years,
originating from wildcats in the Middle East. They were first domesticated to
help control rodent populations in early agricultural societies. Cats possess
extraordinary agility and balance, enabling them to leap several times their
body length and land gracefully. Their keen senses, especially acute hearing and
night vision, make them exceptional hunters. Cats communicate using a combination
of vocal sounds like meows and purrs, body language such as tail position and ear
orientation, and scent marking with glands on their face and paws. Despite their
reputation for independence, many cats form strong attachments to their human
companions, often seeking affection and even following them from room to room.
Interestingly, adult cats spend nearly two-thirds of their lives sleeping—about
16 hours a day—to conserve energy for their hunting bursts. Their grooming
behavior not only keeps their coat clean but also strengthens social bonds when
performed in groups.
